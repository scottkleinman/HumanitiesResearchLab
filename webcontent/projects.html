<p>Dr. Baugh’s research group examines the intersection of religion and environmental attitudes among religious communities in California. In particular, we are interested in ways that race, ethnicity, and class influence environmental values in religious communities. Student researchers help collect and analyze data from focus groups and interviews.</p>

<p>WhatEvery1Says is a large-scale computational text analysis project initiated by <a href="http://4humanities.org" target="_blank">4Humanities</a> and including participants from the University of California, Santa Barbara, Clemson University, and McGill University, as well as California State University, Northridge. We are collecting tens of thousands of online articles from newspapers, magazines, and blogs to form a corpus of public discourse on the humanities. By analyzing the corpus using a variety of statistical methods, we aim to explore the shape of contemporary discourse on the value of the humanities, both to debunk myths about the “uselessness” of the humanities and to discover new ways to communicate their value.</p>

<p>This semester the Asian American Cultural Studies Lab is working with the San Fernando Valley Japanese American Citizens League (SFV JACL) and with a museum exhibit by the Tuna Canyon Detention Station Coalition (TCDSC) to produce researched blog articles.  Our community writing project this semester compares the discourse of a local instance of Japanese American incarceration during the Second World War to the current discourse of the Presidential Executive Order regarding foreign terrorist entry into the United States.</p>

<p>The Cognitive Science of Religion Lab Group uses methods and theories from the cognitive sciences to understand, and explain, both similarities and differences in religious ideas and practices cross-culturally. The lab is currently conducting two projects (1) to better understand why social movements that include ideas about past lives are popular in contemporary Southern California and (2) to understand how common rituals following bereavement and the separation from loved-ones affect the cognitive representation of such individuals.</p>

<p>The Carcerality Research Lab, coordinated by professors Martha Escobar and Leticia Lara, conducts research on issues of incarceration in California. Currently the lab is working on the project “Impact of Language and Migrant Status on Parole Decisions for Incarcerated Latina/o Migrants.” This work examines the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation’s (CDCR) parole process for 138 men and women “lifers” in three different prisons. Particular focus is placed on how language and migrant status inform the ability of imprisoned Latina/o migrants with life sentences to access parole.</p>

<p>The Environmental Digital Humanities lab introduces students to the intersections of environmental history, legal archives, and the digital humanities.  Students who participate in this lab create mind maps using digital software XMIND PRO in order to organize data scanned at the National Archives in Washington, D.C.  The focus of these records center upon two major themes including the racialization of space with regard to Mexican-American experiences in the Civilian Conservation Corps (1933) and ecological debates centering on Japanese-American internment during World War II at the Colorado Indian Reservation in Poston, Arizona.  Students learn how to analyze data based upon themes dealing with racialized discourses centered on human-spatial relations.  A co-authored publication written by Professor Stevie Ruiz and students enrolled in his lab will be submitted to two journals entitled <em>Resilience: A Journal of Environmental Humanities</em> and <em>Radical Teacher</em>,  documenting student experiences and pedagogy working with digital humanities in the field of critical environmental studies.</p>
