            <p>WhatEvery1Says is a large-scale computational text analysis project initiated by <a href="http://4humanities.org"
                    target="_blank">4Humanities</a> and including participants from the University of California,
                Santa Barbara and the University of Miami, as well as California State University, Northridge. We
                are collecting tens of thousands of online articles from newspapers, magazines, and blogs to form a
                corpus of
                public discourse on the humanities. By analyzing the corpus using a variety of statistical methods,
                we aim to explore
                the shape of contemporary discourse on the value of the humanities, both to debunk myths about the
                &ldquo;uselessness&rdquo; of the humanities and to discover new ways to communicate their value.</p>

            <p>Dr. Wiltberger is collaborating with youth in El Salvador and CSUN students to create an online
                digital archive that documents oral histories of a mass repatriation of Salvadoran refugees during
                El Salvador&rsquo;s 1980-1992 civil war, the largest refugee repatriation in Latin American history. This
                project utilizes methodologies and modes of dissemination, including oral histories and accessible
                digital and visual media, so that a community in El Salvador can lead and participate in the
                research process, and so that the archive can be accessible and of benefit to the community and its
                diaspora of migrants, as well as the public. The forthcoming project was named a semi-finalist in
                the 2018 Dorothea Lange-Paul Taylor Prize competition of the Center for Documentary Studies. Once
                published, the archive will be featured in the special digital collections of the Oviatt Library.</p>

            <p>This semester the Asian American Cultural Studies Lab is working with the San Fernando Valley
                Japanese
                American
                Citizens League (SFV JACL) and with a museum exhibit by the Tuna Canyon Detention Station Coalition
                (TCDSC) to
                produce researched blog articles. Our community writing project this semester compares the
                discourse of
                a local
                instance of Japanese American incarceration during the Second World War to the current discourse of
                the
                Presidential Executive Order regarding foreign terrorist entry into the United States.</p>

            <p>The Environmental Digital Humanities lab introduces students to the intersections of environmental
                history, legal archives, and the digital humanities. Students who participate in this lab create mind maps using
                digital software XMIND PRO in order to organize data scanned at the National Archives in Washington, D.C. The focus
                of these records center upon two major themes including the racialization of space with regard to Mexican-American
                experiences in the Civilian Conservation Corps (1933) and ecological debates centering on Japanese-American
                internment during World War II at the Colorado Indian Reservation in Poston, Arizona. Students learn how to analyze
                data based upon themes dealing with racialized discourses centered on human-spatial relations. A co-authored
                publication written by Professor Stevie Ruiz and students enrolled in his lab will be submitted to two journals entitled
                <em>Resilience: A Journal of Environmental Humanities</em> and <em>Radical Teacher</em>, documenting student
                experiences and pedagogy working with digital humanities in the field of critical environmental studies.

            <p>The Carcerality Research Lab, coordinated by professors Martha Escobar and Leticia Lara, conducts
                research on
                issues of incarceration in California. Currently the lab is working on the project &ldquo;Impact of
                Language
                and Migrant
                Status on Parole Decisions for Incarcerated Latina/o Migrants.&rdquo; This work examines the California
                Department of
                Corrections and Rehabilitation&rsquo;s (CDCR) parole process for 138 men and women “lifers” in three
                different prisons.
                Particular focus is placed on how language and migrant status inform the ability of imprisoned
                Latina/o
                migrants
                with life sentences to access parole.</p>

            <p>Dr. Baugh&rsquo;s research group examines the intersection of religion and environmental attitudes among
                religious

                influence
                environmental values in religious communities. Student researchers help collect and analyze data

            <p>The Cognitive Science of Religion Lab Group uses methods and theories from the cognitive sciences to
                understand,
                and explain, both similarities and differences in religious ideas and practices cross-culturally. The
                lab is
                currently conducting two projects (1) to better understand why social movements that include ideas
                about past lives
                are popular in contemporary Southern California and (2) to understand how common rituals following
                bereavement and
                the separation from loved-ones affect the cognitive representation of such individuals.</p>
